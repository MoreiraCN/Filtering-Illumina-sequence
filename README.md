# Filtering Illumina sequence

The following pipeline were used for filter Illumina sequence of two sets of data: (i) whole genomic DNA (gDNA); and (ii) probes of entire chromosomes (obtained by flow sorting and fragmented by a DOP-PCR reaction). Both samples from the species *Holochilus sciureus* (2n = 56+1B, NF = 56), a Neotropical rodent of Oryzomyini tribe.
