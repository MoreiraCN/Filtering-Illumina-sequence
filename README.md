# Filtering Illumina sequence

Here we provide a guide for filtering sequence DNA obtained by Illumina platform. The filtering were performed for two sets of data: (i) entirely genomic DNA (gDNA); and (ii) probes of chromosome DNA (obtained by flow sorting and fragmented by a DOP-PCR). These samples were provided from Holochilus sciureus (2n = 56+1B, NF = 56), a Neotropical rodent from Oryzomyini tribe.
